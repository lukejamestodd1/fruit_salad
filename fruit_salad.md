### Save, add, commit, checkout, merge, push, pull, and repeat


Clone this repository to your projects folder


Add the names of three SURPRISE VEGETABLES here:

1. POTATO
2. BROCCOLI

Save, add, and commit your changes. Push them to the remote.


Create a new branch called stone_fruits.
add the names of three ROOT VEGETABLES here:

1. CARROT
2. RADDISH
3. PARSNIP


Save, add and commit your changes, then push the stone_fruits branch to the remote. 


Great! Now we have two branches locally, and two on the remote. Your code is up to date with the remote.


Go back to master, and merge stone_fruits into master, and push master back to the remote again. Now master should have citrus and stone fruits, on both loacal and remote.
