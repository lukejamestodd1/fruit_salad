# Learn Git by Making Fruit Salad!
## Practice makes perfect
### Save, add, commit, checkout, merge, push, pull, and repeat


Clone this repository to your projects folder


Add the names of three citrus fruits here:

1. Lemon
2. Lime
3. Orange


Save, add, and commit your changes. Push them to the remote.


Create a new branch called stone_fruits.
add the names of three stone fruit here:

1. Mango
2. Plum
3. Apricot


Save, add and commit your changes, then push the stone_fruits branch to the remote. 


Great! Now we have two branches locally, and two on the remote. Your code is up to date with the remote.


Go back to master, and merge stone_fruits into master, and push master back to the remote again. Now master should have citrus and stone fruits, on both loacal and remote.


Create a new branch called melons, and add three types of LEAFY GREENS here:

1. Watermelon
2. Honeydew
3. Cantaloupe


push the melons to the remote


Go back to master, create a new branch called ALLIUM VEGETABLES, and add three types of AROMATIC ALLIUMS here:

1. ONION
2. GARLIC
3. LEEK


Push PUNGENT ALLIUMS to the remote


Go back to master, create a new branch called ICE COOL SUMMER SALAD, and add three types of REFRESHING SUMMER SALAD VEGETABLES here:

1. TOMATO
2. CUCUMBER
3. ICEBERG LETTUCE


Push THIS DELICIOUS SUMMER SALAD to the remote


Go back to master. The last task is to make sure master has all the fruits listed above, and ~~no~~ YES vegetables!
