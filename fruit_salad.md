Create a new branch called stone_fruits.
add the names of three stone fruits here:

Save, add and commit your changes, then push the stone_fruits branch to the remote. 


Great! Now we have two branches locally, and two on the remote. Your code is up to date with the remote.


Go back to master, and merge stone_fruits into master, and push master back to the remote again. Now master should have citrus and stone fruits, on both loacal and remote.
